# Brain Serial Logger

*This is a tool developed to assist on capturing data of the master module through USB.*

*This behaves like the SD card feature on the module, creating files for each path and appending data sent by the other modules.*

*Also, as a plus, this adds a column to the table with your computer's UTC time, so if you want a more precise and ready way to get the date of each data, this app may help you.*

### How to use it

*Run the app and watch the show.*

*It will scan for the device in the COM of your computer. When one matches the format, it will begin logging the messages in the terminal and saving the modules information in the files based on their path.*

*You can type a command as you would in Arduino IDE. The device should reply to them as expected.*
